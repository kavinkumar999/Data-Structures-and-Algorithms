# Linked-List
 A linked list is a linear data structure that contains a sequence of nodes, in which each node contains data and a pointer to another node

**Parts of Linked list**

<br>
> A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is

**Advantages**
- Dyanmic memory allogations
- Able to shirnk and grow and any instant

<br>

**Disadvantages**
- Accessing particular value in linked list is more costly in terms of time and action than performing the same operations in array
- A linked list may not even be more efficient from a memory standpoint because you also have to use memory to store the next value of every node.
