## Data Structure
> Data structure is the special format for storing and organizing data

---
Based on the Organization, it is classified into two types
- Linear Data Structure 
  - Elements are accessed in sequential manner but not compulsory to stored in the sequentialy 
  - Examples : Array , Linked list , Stack , Queue 
- Non-linear Data Strucuture
  - Elements are stored and accessed in sequential manner
  - Examples : Tree , Graph
