## Data Structure
> Data structure is the special format for storing and organizing data

---
Based on the Organization, it is classified into two types
- Linear Data Structure 
  - Elements are accessed in sequential manner but not compulsory to stored in the sequentialy 
  - Examples : Array , Linked list , Stack , Queue 
- Non-linear Data Strucuture
  - Elements are stored and accessed in sequential manner
  - Examples : Tree , Graph
  
## Abstract Data Type

Let us consider the system-defined data types (int,float,double) support the basic addition and subraction operation. For same as the user-defined types we need some operation to defined to solve the problems. To combine the data-structures with their operation is called **Abstrat Data Type**

## Basic Data Structure
 - [Array]()
 - [Linked List]()
 - [Stack]()
 - [Queue]()
 - [Tree]()
 - [Graph]()

## Alogrithm
> An alogrithm is step-by-step unambigous instructions to solve a given problem

## Alogrithm by Topic
- [Math]()
- [String]()
- [Recursion]()
- [Sorting Technique]()
- [Searching Technique]()
## Alogrithm by Paradigm
- [Brute Force]()
- [Greedy Algorithm]()
- [Dynamic Programming]()
- [Divide and Conquer]()
- [Bactracking]()
